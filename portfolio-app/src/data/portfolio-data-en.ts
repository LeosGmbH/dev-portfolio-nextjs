I developed the prototype of a physics-based 2D side-scrolling shooter that focuses on **destructible environments** and **complex chain reactions**.\n\nThe game demonstrates advanced gameplay mechanics: a **sophisticated explosion system** calculates damage based on distance and object type. A **robust state management system** manages multiple simultaneous chain reactions without performance issues.\n\nPlayers interact with a dynamic world of **destructible blocks**, **falling rocks** and **different barrel types** - each with its own explosion radius and fire effects. The project demonstrates a deep understanding of **physics systems**, **event handling** and **optimization techniques**.\n\n More information and technical details can be found in the **README on GitHub**.",

        "**Hide'n Hunt** was created as a project for the 'Labor Games' course in my studies. It is a prototype of an asymmetric 4 vs 1 online multiplayer survival horror game in which up to four survivors compete against one killer.\n\nThe special feature of the game is the **prop mechanic**: survivors can transform into almost any object in the environment to hide or deceive the killer. The central game objective is to work together to **repair five generators** in order to open the **escape gate** and escape the map while the killer hunts the players, knocks them down and places them on **torture chairs**.\n\nTechnically, the project focuses on **online multiplayer** and **networking** with Unity's Netcode for GameObjects. Correct synchronization of player movement, prop transformations, interactions and switching between first- and third-person perspectives was particularly challenging and required many iterations and debugging sessions.\n\nMore information can be found in the **README on GitHub**.",

The final model achieves high success rates in the training levels and at the same time shows transferable behaviour in a separate generalization level.\n\nTechnically, the project combines extensive raycast and vector observations, a hybrid action space (continuous movement + discrete actions) and a PPO algorithm with an LSTM network. A custom Python automation script controls long-term training runs, dynamically adjusts hyperparameters and enables a detailed evaluation of the results with TensorBoard.",
